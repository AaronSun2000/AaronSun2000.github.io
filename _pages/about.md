<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Prof. Rui Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~wr). Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

My research mainly focuses on **Trustworthy Machine Learning**. In my early research, I devoted myself to **backdoor attacks and their positive purposes**. Currently, my research centers on **trustworthy issues of generative AI** (_e.g._, LLMs and Diffusion Models). My long-term goal is to explore general vulnerabilities in generative AI and strive to enhance the safety and security of foundation models.
